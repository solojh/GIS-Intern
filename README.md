## 🏢 Industrial Training Experience (1-Year GIS Internship)

During my one-year industrial training, I had the opportunity to work on three major geospatial data collection and mapping projects. These projects were completed collaboratively with my internship partner in the same company.

### 🔧 Main Projects

1. **Grab 360 Karta Cam Street View Data Collection**  
   Captured and processed 360-degree street view imagery for navigation and mapping enhancement purposes.
